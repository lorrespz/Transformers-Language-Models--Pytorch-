This repo contains a collection of codes for implementing various advanced Language Model architectures (mostly in PyTorch and mostly based on transformers) such as 

1. Encoder (Bert-like models)
   - Transformers_Encoder_(Bert_like_architecture).ipynb
   
2. Decoder (GPT-like models)
   - Transformers_Decoder_(GPT_like)_architecture.ipynb

3. Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq-like models)
  - Encoder_Decoder_(from_scratch)_for_Language_Translation.ipynb

4. Seq2Seq based on LSTM for language translation (TensorFlow)
   - Seq2Seq_LSTM2LSTM_Language_Translation_[TensorFlow].ipynb
